# Flex Project Template

The _Flex Project Template_ is a starting point for Flex solutions of any size. It provides a methodology for managing all the key artifacts of a Twilio Flex solution.  

- It can be used for large projects or simple standalone features
- Many of the most common features requested by Flex customers are packaged in the template
- Each feature is self contained and easily removed if desired  
- Features can be turned on and off using an [adminstration panel](/feature-library/admin-ui)
- You can [deploy this solution and use it to build in just a few minutes](/setup-guides/deploy-to-hosted-flex) by cloning the template and providing your account sid, api key and api secret.

The primary aims of this template are

1. To reduce the time to value when building with Flex
2. To Improve interoperability of features by proposing some standardization
3. To accelerate build velocity by removing the headaches developers have in threading all the pieces together
4. To provide a suite of easily accessible and working features for developers to learn from.

# Why a template?

_The Professional Services_ team has worked with many customers since the original launch of Flex several years ago. There are many ways to build with Flex but the collective experience has learned a few lessons that when followed, make working on Flex a lot easier.

### **One plugin**

Working on flex with multiple plugins can work but as the number of plugins increases so does the likelihood that one plugin does something to the solution that another plugin was not expecting. This can lead to some very difficult and time consuming troubleshooting. By working on a single plugin, we can identify undesired behavior quickly and easily during development.

### **Package Structure**

Working on a single plugin means that there is going to be a lot of code. Therefore we need a package structure that allows developers to modularize their work but also easily pinpoint where their work overlaps with others. This template proposes that package structure making distributed development across a team much easier.

### **Versioning**

Ok it might seem obvious that you would want to do this but it might not be so obvious the most convenient way to do this, this template puts all those provisions in place so you can just get working on the features you want to build!

### **Use Typescript**

Although not strictly necessary, TypeScript immediately affords development teams improved readability and error checking.
